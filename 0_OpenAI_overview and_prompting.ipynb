    "# Tokenization, basics:  \n",
    "When a text is passed to an OpenAI model, it is split into parts, called `tokens`. It's done with `tokenizer`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:      \n",
    "Given a text string (e.g., `\"tiktoken is great!\"`) a tokenizer can split the text string into a list of tokens (e.g., `[\"t\", \"ik\", \"token\", \" is\", \" great\", \"!\"]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting text strings into tokens is useful because GPT models see text in the form of tokens. Knowing how many tokens are in a text string can tell you (a) whether the string is too long for a text model to process and (b) how much an OpenAI API call costs (as usage is priced by token).  \n",
    "For example, the longest word in English, `pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis` tokenized with [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer) would have:  \n",
    "* 15 Tokens  \n",
    "* 45 chars  \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](img/tokenization.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see different colors represent different tokens that the original word was split into. If you click on `TOKEN IDS` button, the tokens will be represented as list of numbers. These numbers will be passed to a model instead of string tokens, because the model itself cannot recognize strings, but only numbers.  \n",
